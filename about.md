I'm a fiber practitioner with intensive interests in spinning, weaving, dyeing, and knitting (and as much crocheting as I need to get by). In my day job, I have equally intensive interests in data modeling, digital publishing, digital scholarly editing, and other areas of digital humanities. I teach digital humanities at Northeastern University and also direct the Digital Scholarship Group in the Northeastern University Library.
